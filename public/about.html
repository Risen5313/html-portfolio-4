<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there. I was born in Ponce. Puerto Rico was on August 24, 1989, but 
  my family and I moved to Ohio on January 20, 2001. I graduated from 
  High School on October 20, 2007. I attended college to take several classes 
  since I was initially unsure of what I wanted to do. 2010, I enrolled in the 
  Visual Communication: Graphic Design Associative Degree at Cuyahoga Community 
  College (Parma). .
  </p>

<p>I had to work hard to develop the skills and dedication for this degree 
  at first since I wasn't sure what it was all about. I took Graphic Design
   classes from 2010-2015 and then took a two-year break. I felt refreshed 
   and found a new motivation to finish the degree I started in 2010. One of 
   my happiest moments was graduating and receiving my Visual Communication: 
   Graphic Design Associative degree on June 16, 2021. I also took a few more 
   classes to receive the Visual Communication: Graphic Design Certificate on 
   June 16, 2022. I'm currently trying to earn a Bachelor's degree in Graphic 
   Design.</p>

<p>I love riding my bicycle, joining fun running races, playing video games, 
  meditating, exploring park trails, and riding a kayak. Learning more about 
  Graphic Design, Web Development, and Digital Marketing keeps me the most busy. 
  I want to further expand my knowledge in different areas as well. .</p>
